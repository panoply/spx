# Getting Help

SPX currently doesn't have a centralized hub where developers and users can gather. Given its recent introduction, setting up a dedicated Discord or chat platform isn't deemed essential at this time, though this could change in the future. However, if you're seeking guidance or wish to connect with others utilizing SPX, you can engage with diverse developers across various communities and online forums.

> For developers with limited experience, obtaining assistance may prove challenging. SPX operates under the assumption of an intermediate level of knowledge. Please keep this in mind.

### Shopify Developers

The author and main contributors of SPX are active members of the [Shopify Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/shopify-developers-597504637167468564), which, despite the name, is not affiliated with Shopify but is instead a community of developers working on various projects, with extensive experience with SPX. They can often be found there on a daily basis. You can reach us in the Projects ~ SPX channel.

### Blanklob Community

Contributors and users of SPX are also available on the [Blanklob Discord](https://discord.gg/blanklob-community-983602196493004820), where you can reach out via the Projects ~ Sissel Channel. While the Discord primarily focuses on Shopify theme development, similar to the Shopify Developers Discord, you'll find a variety of discussions around web technologies.
